Welcome to my Portfolio of GIS Projects for GIS Courses at Heinz College at CMU.
## ${{\color{Goldenrod}\Huge{\textsf{About Me }}}}\$ :grinning: 	:computer: 	:hiking_boot:

I have always been a visual learner and appreciated good graphics. It still amazes me the range of ways to interpret data based on how it is presented. I find that maps and geocoded data are particularly effective ways of conveying data. <br>
I received my degree in Computer Engineering from Michigan Technological University in 2019. I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at Heinz College and Carnegie Mellon University. <br>
I love being outside, hiking, camping, kayaking, rock hounding. I love crafts, particularly making jewelry with the rock I find, glass art and embroidery.


## ${{\color{Goldenrod}\Huge{\textsf{What I hope to learn \}}}}\$ :brain: 	:raising_hand_woman:
I hope to deepen my understanding of spatial data analysis and visualization techniques. Through this course, I aim to gain proficiency in using GIS software and tools to collect, manage, analyze, and interpret geographic data effectively. Ultimately, I hope to develop practical skills in GIS that will enhance my ability to tackle real-world challenges and contribute meaningfully to interdisciplinary projects and research endeavors.
