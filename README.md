# GIS Portfolio 

Welcome to my Portfolio of GIS Projects for GIS Courses at Heinz College at CMU.

## About Me 😄 💻 🥾
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/njmcgrat/GIS-Portfolio/assets/143455814/1b97f39f-7e01-4d5c-bfc8-e865c4771869" width="150" height="200" />

I have always been a visual learner and appreciated good graphics. It still amazes me the range of ways to interpret data based on how it is presented. I find that maps and geocoded data are particularly effective ways of conveying data. <br>
I received my degree in Computer Engineering from Michigan Technological University in 2019. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at Heinz College and Carnegie Mellon University. <br>
I love being outside, hiking, camping, kayaking, rock hounding. I love crafts, particularly making jewelry with the rocks I find, glass art, and embroidery.

## What I Hope to Learn 🧠 🙋‍♀️
I hope to deepen my understanding of spatial data analysis and visualization techniques. Through this course, I aim to gain proficiency in using GIS software and tools to collect, manage, analyze, and interpret geographic data effectively. Ultimately, I hope to develop practical skills in GIS that will enhance my ability to tackle real-world challenges and contribute meaningfully to interdisciplinary projects and research endeavors.
